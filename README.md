# ParallelComputing - 2D Convolution using CUDA

### About this project

Implementation of 2D Convolution with Sequential method and Parallel Method using CUDA.
In particular , you will find : 
* Global and Global + Constant
* Shared and Shared + Constant

To read the images, I used the ppm format and C++ as support code.
